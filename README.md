# Fusion Library

Arduino library for performing digital sensor fusion using various filter
implementations.

## Filters

* Complementary
* Kalman
* Extended Kalman

Quaternions will also be used with the Kalman filters.

## TODO

* Should like into supporting multiple different degrees of freedom.
* Find a good way to run unit tests on everything.
