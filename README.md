# Fusion Library

Arduino library for performing digital sensor fusion using various filter
implementations.

## Filters

* Complementary
* Kalman
* Extended Kalman

Quaternions will also be used with all of the filters. (Eventually)

## TODO

* Should look into supporting multiple different degrees of freedom.
* Find a good way to run unit tests on everything.
* Add a Direction Cosine Matrix (DCM) filter to the mix.
